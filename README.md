### RESEARCH OVERVIEW
My research examines road networks as complex systems using network science tools to analyse properties at macro-, meso-, and micro-scales. Global network properties, efficiency, and robustness are investigated, along with community structures and core-periphery patterns. Nodal-level metrics, like centrality measures, are computed to understand network characteristics. Different node removal strategies are evaluated for urban road network robustness, showing targeted disruptions using centrality measures to be more effective than random strategies. An epidemic theory approach, specifically the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, is proposed for modeling traffic congestion spread in urban cities, incorporating road network structure for improved accuracy in real-world congestion conditions and congestion mitigation strategies. Open source traffic data was utilised for the study.
