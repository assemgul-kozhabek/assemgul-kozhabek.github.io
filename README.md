Abstract: The continuous urbanisation and increase in vehicle ownership have increasingly exacerbated traffic congestion problems. In this paper, we advocate the use of epidemic theory to model the spreading of traffic congestion in urban cities. Specifically, we use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model but propose to explicitly consider the road network structure in the model to understand the contagion process of road congestion. This departs from the classical SIR model where homogeneous mixing based on the law of mass action is assumed. For this purpose, we adopt the N-intertwined modeling framework for the SIR model based on continuous-time Markov chain analysis. In our evaluation, we used two real-world traffic datasets collected in California and Los Angeles. We compare our results against both classical and average-degree-based SIR models. Our results show better agreement between the model and actual congestion conditions and shed light on how congestion propagates across a road network. We see the potential application of insights gained from this work on the development of traffic congestion mitigation strategies.

This paper presents a robustness assessment in terms of inducing damage to the functioning of real-world urban road networks via a comparative analysis of the efficacy of various network perturbation strategies. Specifically, we assess the network robustness through an iterative node removal process considering five targeted (deterministic) and two random (stochastic) strategies. The targeted node removal strategies are based on different centrality measures. We study the robustness of 10 road networks of densely populated cities using three different metrics: the size of the largest connected component, global efficiency, and local efficiency. Our findings suggest that targeted disruptions utilizing centrality measures are more effective in disrupting the network than random ones. However, some centrality measures have a strong correlation with each other and thus, requiring combinations of different removal orders to gain more comprehensive insights into the ability of the network to withstand perturbations. We find centrality measures considering shortest paths are more effective in degrading the robustness of the network as a whole while centrality measures that only consider immediate connectivity are better in disrupting the local effectiveness of the network. Interestingly, we also find that removing nodes can counter-intuitively increase the local efficiency of the network.
